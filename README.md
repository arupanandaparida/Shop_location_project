Shop Registration and Location Distance System
Project Description

Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance between shops and a user-input location using latitude and longitude (Haversine formula or another distance algorithm).
Search by Location: Find shops within a certain radius from the given coordinates.
Responsive UI: Works on both mobile and desktop devices.
